/**
 * A logical plan node that contains exactly what was parsed from SQL.
 *
 * This is used to hold information parsed from SQL when there are multiple implementations of a
 * query or command. For example, CREATE TABLE may be implemented by different nodes for v1 and v2.
 * Instead of parsing directly to a v1 CreateTable that keeps metadata in CatalogTable, and then
 * converting that v1 metadata to the v2 equivalent, the sql [[CreateTableStatement]] plan is
 * produced by the parser and converted once into both implementations.
 *
 * Parsed logical plans are not resolved because they must be converted to concrete logical plans.
 *
 * Parsed logical plans are located in Catalyst so that as much SQL parsing logic as possible is be
 * kept in a [[org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser]].
